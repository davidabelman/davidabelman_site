                Situation
            </span>
            <p>
                An e-commerce site wanted to increase the proportion of new registrants converting to a premium subscription. However, deep promotions were being sent to millions of users indescriminantly, potentially damaging the brand. This project was carried out to automatically identify the top 1-10% of potential subscribers on a daily basis, thus enabling far more targeted promotions.</p>  
            <hr>
            <span class='heading-custom'>
                Solution
            </span>
            <p>
                A logistic regression model has been built, identifying 1-week old users most likely to purchase. By identifying just 10% of the population, 75% of future purchases are caught (i.e. recall of 75% by picking 1 in 10 users). Users who are predicted to purchase by the model but who <em>haven't</em> yet purchased can now be sent appropriate discounts.</p><p>The project uses user data and event log data (tracked from KISSmetrics). Overall 8 different features have been identified to predict likely purchasers (though many more were tested). Model parameters (and the choice of logistic regression over other models) have been based tests using 20-fold cross validation across a dataset with over 100,000 registrants.</p><p>In addition to predicting likely purchasers on a daily basis, the script produces a daily report on previous prediction success (graphically and in CSV format).

                Schematic showing design of the final code. The upper half shows the pipeline for learning and optimising parameters, outputting charts, reports and cross-validation results, and saving the model. The lower half shows the process repeated on a daily basis, whereby 1-week old registrants are treated as a the test set, and the most likely purchasers are identified.

                How it works
            </span>
            <p>
                User data and event log data is extracted from Redshift using a Python script. In training, this data is preprocessed, feature engineering takes place, and a model (with parameters optimised previously) is saved to an external file structure. The logistic regression model is built using Python's scikit-learn package. This training process is all controlled through one main pipeline script, calling on separate modules as detailed in the diagram above. Separately, and on a daily basis, a report script pulls the latest data from Redshift, calculates likely purchasers (based on their first week of data, and using the model generated previously) and exports a list of user IDs for promotional purposes. Additionally, all previous predicted purchasers are re-visited - what proportion have now purchased (and what proportion of all purchasers were predicted)? These results are output on a daily basis.

                Teams of analysts undertake a lot of work in providing interesting and enlightening sports statistics to commentators and journalists. What if everyone - from these people in the media, to the common man and woman down the pub - could ask any 'stats' question (within a specified domain, for example Premier League football) and get an automatic answer back immediately?

            <p>
                This is an ongoing project to make such data available for anyone to access with ease. For example, you can ask the system questions such as <em>'Which players assisted the most goals in a single game last season?'</em> or <em>'Show me the premier league table only considering games between Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool.'</em>. Currently, sentences must be built up using a series of dropdowns (this tree-like structure can generate thousands of unique questions). The next stage of this project is to incorporate natural language processing elements to allow free-text input.

            <p>
                Data is scraped from websites offering automatically generated online commentary. This data is parsed with regular expressions in Python, extracting all individual events from the match (with associated player names, timestamps, etc.). This data is stored in various databases (on a team level, player level, and event level).</p><p>
                A user interface built in Javascript allows the user to build up grammatically correct sentences using drop-down menus. The user can also fill in 'blanks' within sentences (for example, specific team or player names). The query is submitted, calling a back-end in Python. This takes the user's input, converts to a SQL query, and retrieves the correct information from the correct database. This is passed back to the user as JSON (via an AJAX call), and displayed in tabular format, and as a chart (generated with D3.js).

                During a football match, tweets of two sets of fans are extracted using specified tags from the Twitter firehose. Information is extracted from tweets - including positive and negative sentiment, tweet 'passion', and overall volume of tweets. The ebbs and flows of these metrics are plotted in an interactive chart using D3.</p><p> An example match for the project can be found <a href='#'>here</a>.

                Data is extracted from the Twitter firehose for pre-specified fan hashtags. The results are parsed in Python, and sentiment is calculated using basic word lists, with sentiment values by word altered as time goes by as more data is collected (previously unkown words near other words with high positive/negative sentiment have their own sentiment values altered slightly, by assuming similar-sentiment words are used concurrently on average).</p><p> The Python script's output is used as JSON data within a basic interactive D3.js visualisation.

            <p>
                This project uses recent advances in speech synthesis technology allowing speech to be altered <em>in real time</em>. A Microsoft Kinect is connected to a Hidden Markov Model based synthesiser, using software developed at Mons University (pHTS). This allows a user to make gestures in real-time, which control the prosody (vocal ups and downs) of the speech synthesiser as it produces speech. This is demonstrated in the video below.</p><p> The work has since been published in Speech Prosody (2014 Dublin conference), and the original thesis can be found <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27702211/David_Abelman_MSc_thesis.pdf' target='blank'>here</a>.

            <p>
                I have worked in various musical capacities, from leading semi-professional music groups in London, to writing, recording and producing music for my own projects, and commissioned for other groups and individuals.

                The video below is one of a series of songs and videos created for 60's influenced band 'Zig Zag Birds' by myself and <a href='http://edwardrandell.wordpress.com/' target='blank'>Edward Randell</a> in 2011. All music was recorded live in the video clip you see (so yes, three days recording guitar lines dressed as zombies). The whole collection of videos can all be found on our <a href='http://www.youtube.com/zigzagbirds' target='blank'>Youtube</a> channel.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have also produced, written and recorded music for a variety of other artists, as well as my own EP, <a href = 'http://davidrael.bandcamp.com/'>In Time</a> (2012) which can also be found below.

            <p>
                <a href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/robbjones'>Rob Jones</a> and myself founded <a href='http://bangscience.org/'>Bang! Science Magazine</a> in 2007. Our first issue raised all funds independently, had over 30 content contributors, and was distributed to over 5,000 students around colleges in Oxford. Focusing on fresh, entertaining articles and eye-catching design, the magazine still publishes three times per year (now through <a href='http://www.ospl.org/'>Oxford Student Publications Ltd</a>), and is Oxford's largest science magazine with a readership of over 7,000.
            </p>  
            <p>
                Editors and contributors for Bang! Magazine have since gone on to write for national publications such as The Guardian and The Times in a scientfic capacity.

                An ongoing project to visualise collections of news articles in interesting ways. The relationship between news articles is seldom expressed in a good way by newspapers (other than a 'related stories' box) - this project aims to explore if there are more visual and useful ways to allow users to see evolution of stories over time.</p>
