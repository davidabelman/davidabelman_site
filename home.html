                Situation
            </span>
            <p>
                An e-commerce site wanted to increase the proportion of new registrants converting to a premium subscription. However, deep promotions were being sent to millions of users indescriminantly, potentially damaging the brand. This project was carried out to automatically identify the top 1-10% of potential subscribers on a daily basis, thus enabling far more targeted promotions.</p>  
            <hr>
            <span class='heading-custom'>
                Solution
            </span>
            <p>
                A logistic regression model has been built, identifying 1-week old users most likely to purchase. By identifying just 10% of the population, 75% of future purchases are caught (i.e. recall of 75% by picking 1 in 10 users). Users who are predicted to purchase by the model but who <em>haven't</em> yet purchased can now be sent appropriate discounts.</p><p>The project uses user data and event log data (tracked from KISSmetrics). Overall 8 different features have been identified to predict likely purchasers (though many more were tested). Model parameters (and the choice of logistic regression over other models) have been based tests using 20-fold cross validation across a dataset with over 100,000 registrants.</p><p>In addition to predicting likely purchasers on a daily basis, the script produces a daily report on previous prediction success (graphically and in CSV format). For a full (anonymised) PDF report, please contact me using the contact form on this site.

                Schematic showing design of the final code. The upper half shows the pipeline for learning and optimising parameters, outputting charts, reports and cross-validation results, and saving the model. The lower half shows the process repeated on a daily basis, whereby 1-week old registrants are treated as a the test set, and the most likely purchasers are identified.

                How it works
            </span>
            <p>
                User data and event log data is extracted from Redshift using a Python script. In training, this data is preprocessed, feature engineering takes place, and a model (with parameters optimised previously) is saved to an external file structure. The logistic regression model is built using Python's scikit-learn package. This training process is all controlled through one main pipeline script, calling on separate modules as detailed in the diagram above. Separately, and on a daily basis, a report script pulls the latest data from Redshift, calculates likely purchasers (based on their first week of data, and using the model generated previously) and exports a list of user IDs for promotional purposes. Additionally, all previous predicted purchasers are re-visited - what proportion have now purchased (and what proportion of all purchasers were predicted)? These results are output on a daily basis.

                Teams of analysts undertake a lot of work in providing interesting and enlightening sports statistics to commentators and journalists. What if everyone - from these people in the media, to the common man and woman down the pub - could ask any 'stats' question (within a specified domain, for example Premier League football) and get an automatic answer back immediately? Intermediate results are available <a href='http://davidabelman.pythonanywhere.com' target='_blank')>here.</a></p>

            <p>
                This is an ongoing project to make such data available for anyone to access with ease. For example, you can ask the system questions such as <em>'Which players assisted the most goals in a single game last season?'</em> or <em>'Show me the premier league table only considering games between Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City and Liverpool.'</em>. Currently, sentences must be built up using a series of dropdowns (this tree-like structure can generate thousands of unique questions). The next stage of this project is to incorporate natural language processing elements to allow free-text input.

            </span>
            <p>
                Data is scraped from websites offering automatically generated online commentary. This data is parsed with regular expressions in Python, extracting all individual events from the match (with associated player names, timestamps, etc.). This data is stored in various databases (on a team level, player level, and event level).</p><p>
                A user interface built in Javascript allows the user to build up grammatically correct sentences using drop-down menus. The user can also fill in 'blanks' within sentences (for example, specific team or player names). The query is submitted, calling a back-end in Python. This takes the user's input, converts to a SQL query, and retrieves the correct information from the correct database. This is passed back to the user as JSON (via an AJAX call), and displayed in tabular format, and as a chart (generated with D3.js).

            <p>
                During a football match, tweets of two sets of fans are extracted using specified tags from the Twitter firehose. Information is extracted from tweets - including positive and negative sentiment, tweet 'passion', and overall volume of tweets. The ebbs and flows of these metrics are plotted in an interactive chart using D3.</p><p> An example match for the project can be found <a href='#'  target='_blank'>here</a>.

            <span class='heading-custom'>
                How it works
            </span>
            <p>
                Data is extracted from the Twitter firehose for pre-specified fan hashtags. The results are parsed in Python, and sentiment is calculated using basic word lists, with sentiment values by word altered as time goes by as more data is collected (previously unkown words near other words with high positive/negative sentiment have their own sentiment values altered slightly, by assuming similar-sentiment words are used concurrently on average).</p><p> The Python script's output is used as JSON data within a basic interactive D3.js visualisation.

                State of the art speech synthesisers work well at reading out neutral text (for example, from a newspaper) though are in general poor at expressing convincing emotion. Additionally, synthesisers are rarely controlled in real-time by a user.

                This project uses recent advances in speech synthesis technology allowing speech to be altered <em>in real time</em>. A Microsoft Kinect is connected to a Hidden Markov Model based synthesiser, using software developed at Mons University (pHTS). This allows a user to make gestures in real-time, which control the prosody (vocal ups and downs) of the speech synthesiser as it produces speech. This is demonstrated in the video below.</p><p> The work has since been published in Speech Prosody (2014 Dublin conference), and the original thesis can be found <a href='https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/27702211/David_Abelman_MSc_thesis.pdf' target='blank'>here</a>.

                Most internet sites are aimed at tech-savvy users - in particular social networks. For someone like my grandmother, staying in touch using email/Skype is still too complicated for her to do without somebody else helping her each time.
            </p>  
            <p>
                I decided to make a simple social network application which would allow me to stay in touch with my grandmother - and the rest of my family - whilst travelling around Asia in 2014. This was also my first ever project using the Flask microframework and other backend development tools.

                I have created a simple social network, called <a href='http://saltpepper.club' target='_blank'>'Salt and Pepper'</a>, designed with those with very little or no internet experience in mind. The site allows users to create groups, send messages, take photos, add photos from an image search, upload photos, and dictate messages verbally - all using extremely simple, large orange buttons, with detailed instructions in large fonts. And it has been tested successfully on my Grandmother!

                I’ve used Flask as the framework for the backend, and a little Twitter Bootstrap on the frontend. Most javascipt uses Jquery. The website functionality is split pretty evenly between Flask, and Jquery AJAX calls to the backend. I use MongoHQ for the database, Mailgun to send out email, Dropbox for user-uploaded content, Embedly to resize images on the fly, Google Chrome web speech kit for dictation, and Heroku for deployment. Finally, analytics are captured using the fabulous Mixpanel.

                Situation
            </span>
            <p>
                A huge part of learning a language is through practicing conversation with native speakers - but unfortunately, many people around the world don't have access to a native speaker of the language they are learning, or are too shy to practice once paired up.
            </p>
            
            <span class='heading-custom'>
                Solution
            </span>
            <p>
                Both to solve this problem, and play with Google's Speech Recognition API (this was actually my first project using Javascript!), I have created a mock-up of a 'conversation-bot' with which users can practice typical conversation scenarios online, without requiring a human partner. A very basic demo can be found <a href='#' target='_blank'>here</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                A large number of scenarios would be catered for - buying tickets at a train station, visiting a restaurant, going to the shops/market, meeting people, checking into a hotel, etc. Within each scenario, a graph/tree of possible conversation routes is pre-programmed into the backend. The app starts the conversation, with a pre-recorded sound clip from a native speaker. At this point (and at each subsequent branch of the tree), the user must say one of the possible responses. These are provided on the user's screen, though words can be missing (if the user wants a more challenging experience). If the user would like to hear the 'correct' pronunciation of one of the responses, they may click on it and listen. Once the user says once of the responses, the app 'listens', matches the response with the closest option, and scores the user based on how well the speech recognition matched the expected response. Words which are mispronounced are stored for the user to practice in isolation later.
